\section{Conclusion}

Stochastic orders are excellent tools to aid in the design of randomized algorithms. We see this through their
application in simplifying proofs for bounding the errors of these algorithms. Though our focus is on 
network algorithmics, stochastic orders can be applied in a broader context. We hope that through our
paper, researchers are made aware of the benefits of exploiting these tools.
