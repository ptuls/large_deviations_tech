	abstract = {The flow size distribution is a useful metric for traffic modeling and
				management. It is well known however that its estimation based on
				sampled data is problematic. Previous work has shown that flow sampling
				(FS) offers enormous statistical benefits over packet sampling, however
				it suffers from high resource requirements and is not currently used in
				routers. In this paper we present Dual Sampling, which can to a large
				extent provide flow-sampling-like statistical performance for			
				packet-sampling-like computational cost. Our work is grounded in a
				Fisher information based approach recently used to evaluate a number of
				sampling schemes, excluding however FS, for TCP flows. We show how to
				revise and extend the approach to include FS as well as DS and others,
				and how to make rigorous and fair comparisons. We show how DS
				significantly outperforms other packet based methods, but also prove
			 	that DS is inferior to flow sampling. However, since DS is a
				two-parameter family of methods which includes FS as a special case, DS
				can be used to approach flow sampling continuously. We then describe a
				packet sampling based implementation of DS and analyze its key
				computational costs to show that router implementation is feasible. Our
				approach offers insights into many issues, including how the notions of
				`flow quality' and `packet gain' can be used to understand the relative
				performance of methods, and how the problem of optimal sampling can be
				formulated. Our work is theoretical with some simulation support and a
 			    case study on Internet data.},

@techreport{Tune10Skampling,
	author = {Paul Tune and Darryl Veitch},
	title = {On Sampling, Sketching and Skampling},
	institution = {University of Melbourne},
	note = {Available upon request},
	year = {2010},
	abstract = {Router level measurements are increasing in importance, and sophistication, as 
			rising security concerns join traffic management needs. However, due to the high speed
			nature of core routers, tracking traffic characteristics beyond the IP header level is very
			challenging. Two approaches to this problem are traffic sampling and sketching. In this
			paper we focus on the flow size distribution, which is important both for security and
			traffic engineering. We first show that flow sampling, which has been shown to be inherently
			superior to many other forms of sampling, is implementable with current router technology.
			We then perform, for the first time, an information theoretic comparison between flow
			sampling and sketching,  which reveals their comparative underlying efficiency in
			capturing information relevant to flow size, and through their associated Cram\'{e}r--Rao
			lower bounds on variance, gives the fundamental limits of flow size estimates. The
			performance comparison is first made in an absolute information-theoretic sense, and then
			in the presence of resource constraints according to simple models of router
			implementations. We show how we can significantly improve the estimation quality of the
			sketch with minor modifications. Finally, we study a joint sketching-sampling system. We
			show how insights developed in this paper are valuable in the design and optimization of
			such systems.}
