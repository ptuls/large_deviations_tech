 Makes comments on Poisson versus periodic probing, and average separation compared to TCP's RTT.
 Wierd reasoning whereby bias decreases and variance decreases when probes sent Closer together! (because looking at ability of probes to measure transient TCP loss).
  Much of the paper is similar to tomo_loss_CDHT_1999, but with some extras details making it less dense, and some proofs omitted. The simulation section is expanded, many empirical results showing variance and closeness to real loss as a fn of ns TCP parameters, with interpretations.}

Actual aim is to locate bottlenecks, loss is used to find the logical tree first, then
bottleneck capacity estimation for the localisation.
Nice intro to reliable multicasting motivating need to know topology, also mtrace later on.
Defines 'true' and `false' shared losses over a set of receivers, ie losses over the shared
path, or separately over both non-shared paths, and then solves the familar basic
scheme (binary two leaf topology, iid losses).
The expression (and estimates) for shared losses are used to coalesce nodes pairwise from
the bottom up, creating a binary tree (one fuses the nodes with the highest probability
over all receiver pairs). Issues in the non-binary case are explored, based on comparing
shared loss probs under different scenarios, with a threshold. Well written.}

Measures link delay variance (not delay itself) over a tree using iid Bernouilli losses, assuming topology known.
Based on fact that covariance over receivers is just variance over shared path.
Quantifies increase of variance due to temporal and spatial dependence, notes consistency regardless provided ergodic.
Looks for optimal convex combination to minimize variance. Details rely on standard theorems but messy
matrix calculations.
Can go to higher moments of shared path at node k if node degree is higher, in terms of the first moment at leaves (in fact, the precise connection is via cumulants).
Incorporates effects of lost packets reducing amount of available data.
Both model and ns simulations.
Mentions that could use delay variance to infer topology (like do in loss work)}
